Storage
----------
.. Contents::

In the *Virtual Machines* -> *Storage* section, you can create and manage drives for virtual machines. Here you can add new disks, create templates and snapshots of a volume, view the list of snapshots for each volume.

Drive list
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note:: If you have just started working with CloudStack and you do not have virtual machines yet, you have no disks in the list. Once you create a VM, a root disk is created for it automatically. Creation of an additional disk takes resources and requires expenses. Please, make sure you definitely need an additional data disk. 

Here you can find a list of disks existing for your user. 

.. figure:: _static/Storage_List2.png
   
Domain Administrator can see disks of all accounts in the domain.

.. figure:: _static/Storage_List_Admin4.png
   
Disks can be viewed as a list or as a grid of cards. Switch the view by clicking a view icon |view icon|/|box icon| in the upper-right corner.

Filtering of Drives
""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Root disks are visually distinguished from data disks in the list. There is an option to display only spare disks which allows saving user's time in certain cases. 

As in all lists, there is the filtering tool for selecting drives by zones and/or types. You also can apply the search tool selecting a drive by its name or a part of the name.

.. figure:: _static/Storage_FilterAndSearch3.png

For better distinguising of drives in the list you can group them by zones and/or types, like in the figure below:

.. figure:: _static/Storage_Grouping2.png

Domain Administrators can see the list of drives of all accounts in the domain. Filtering by accounts is available to Administrators.

.. figure:: _static/Storage_FilterAndSearch_Admin.png
   
For each drive in the list the following information is presented:

- Drive name,
- Size,
- State - Ready or Allocated.

The Actions button |actions icon| is available to the right. It expands the list of actions for a disk. See the information on actions in the :ref:`Actions_on_Disks` section below.

Create New Volume
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the *Storage* section you can create new volumes. Please, note that if you are aimed at creation of a virtual machine, we do not recommend starting from adding new disks to the system. You can go right to the *Virtual Machines* section and create a VM. A root disk will be cerated for the VM automatically.

.. _static/CreateVMwithRD.png
 
If necessary, you can create a data disk and attach it to your VM. By clicking the "Create" button |create icon| in the bottom-right corner you will open a creation form. Please, make sure you definitely need an additional disk as it takes resources and requires expenses. If you do not have disks yet, when clicking "Create", a dialog box will ask you if you surely want to create a drive. Confirm your creation action by clicking "CONTINUE":

.. figure:: _static/AdditionalDiskNotification.png
   
A creation form will appear.

.. figure:: _static/Storage_Create3.png

To create a new volume fill in the fields:

.. note:: Required fields are marked with an asterisk (*).

- Name * - Enter a name of the volume. 
- Zone * - Select a zone from the drop-down list.
- Disk offering * - Select from the list of available offerings opening it in a modal window by clicking "SELECT". The list of available disk offerings is determined in the `configuration file <https://github.com/bwsw/cloudstack-ui/blob/master/config-guide.md#service-offering-availability>`_ by Administrator. 

In the modal window you can see the name and short description for each disk offering and a radio-button to select any option.

.. figure:: _static/Storage_Create_Select1.png

For each disk offering you can expand detailed information by clicking the arrow icon or the whole line in the list. In the appeared section you will see a range of parameters. The following parameters are shown by default:

- Bandwidth (MB/s): Read/Write rates;
- IOPS: Read/Write rates and Min/Max values;
- Storage type;
- Provisioning type;
- Creation date.

Use the scrolling tool to view them all.

More parameters can be added via the `configuration file <https://github.com/bwsw/cloudstack-ui/blob/master/config-guide.md#disk-offering-parameters>`_ by an Administrator.

.. figure:: _static/Storage_Create_Select_Expand.png

Select a disk offering in the list and click "SELECT".

.. figure:: _static/Storage_Create_SelectDO.png

If the selected disk offering has a custom disk size (it is set by Administrator), you can change the disk size moving the slider to the volume size you wish or entering a value into the number field.

.. figure:: _static/Storage_Create_ResizeDisk1.png
   
Click "CREATE" to save the settings and create the new volume. You will see the drive appears in the list.

.. figure:: _static/Storage_Created1.png

Click "CANCEL" to drop all the settings. The drive will not be created then.

.. _Storage_Info:

Volume Details Sidebar
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By clicking a disk in the list you can access the information on the volume. 

.. figure:: _static/Storage_Info3.png

At the right sidebar you can find two tabs:

1. Volume tab - Provides the information on the disk volume:

- General information - Presents disk size, date and time of creation, the storage type (shared, local).
- Description - Allows entering a short description to the drive. Click at the Description card and enter a short description in the text block.
    
.. figure:: _static/Storage_Description2.png

Click "Save" to save the description. Description will be saved to volume `tags <https://github.com/bwsw/cloudstack-ui/wiki/Tags>`_.

You can edit the description by clicking the "Edit" button |edit icon| in the tab.

.. figure:: _static/Storage_DescriptionEdit2.png
   
- Disk offering - Presents the information on the disk offering chosen at disk creation.
    
2. Snapshots tab - Allows creating disk snapshots. Snapshots can be taken for disks with the "Ready" status only.

   Click the "Add" button |create icon| and enter in the dialog box:

    - Name - Define a name for the snapshot. It is auto-generated in the format ``<date>-<time>``. But you can specify any name you wish.
    - Description - Add a description of the snapshot to know what it contains.  
 
   Then click "Create" and see the snapshot has appeared in the list. 

.. figure:: _static/Storage_CreateSnapshot2.png
      
Every snapshot is saved in a separate card. There you will see the name and time of the snapshot. 

For each snapshot the list of actions is available. Find more information on snapshot actions in the :ref:`Actions_on_Snapshot_Volume` section below.

.. _Actions_on_Snapshot_Volume:

Snapshots Action Box 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
.. note:: For a newly taken snapshot all actions except "Delete" are disabled until the snapshot is backed up to the Secondary Storage that may take some time. Once it is backed up, a full range of actions is available to a user.

Likewise the Virtual Machine information tab, the same actions are available for a snapshot:
     
- **Create a template** - Allows creating a template from the snapshot. This template can be used for VM creation.

Fill in the form to register a new template:
   
.. note:: Required fields are marked with an asterisk (*).  
   
- Name * - Enter a name of the new template.
- Description * - Provide a short description of the template.
- OS type * - Select an OS type from the drop-down list.
- Group - Select a group from the drop-down list.
- Password enabled - Tick this option if the template has the password change script installed. That means the VM created on the base of this template will be accessed by a password, and this password can be reset.
- Dynamically scalable - Tick this option if the template contains XS/VM Ware tools to support the dynamic scaling of VM CPU/memory.
 
Click "SHOW ADDITIONAL FIELDS" to expand the list of optional settings. It allows creating a template that requires HVM.
     
Once all fields are filled in click "Create" to create the new template.

.. figure:: _static/Storage_CreateTemplate2.png

- **Create Volume** - Allows creating a volume from the snapshot.

Type a name for a new volume into the Name field in the modal window. Click “Create” to register a new volume.

.. figure:: _static/Storage_SnapshotActions_CreateVolume1.png

Click “Cancel” to cancel the volume creation.

- **Revert Volume To Snapshot** - Allows turning the volume back to the state of the snapshot. 

In the dialog box confirm your action. Please, note, the virtual machine the volume is assigned to will be rebooted.

.. figure:: _static/Storage_SnapshotActions_Revert1.png

- **Delete** - Allows deleting the snapshot. Click “Delete” in the Action box and confirm your action in modal window. The snapshot will be deleted. Click “Cancel” to cancel the snapshot deleting.

.. Find the detailed description in the :ref:`Actions_on_Snapshots` section.
