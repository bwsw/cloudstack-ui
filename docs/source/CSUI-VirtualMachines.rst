Virtual Machines
-------------------

.. Contents::

*Virtual Machines* is the starting section. Here and in all other views we have implemented a “one-step” approach, and we also made it work without moving from view to view. So all actions on VMs can be managed from one screen view.

In this section you can perform actions over a VM that is create, start, stop, delete it. Besides, here you can configure the machine editing its service offering parameters, group, firewall rules. Finally, you can access a VM selecting the most appropriate way. We support three options for accessing a VM: via the console, via Webshell and via HTTP.

.. _static/VMs_Management.png

Below you will find the detailed information on the aforementioned options for VM management via CloudStack-UI.

Virtual Machines List
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At this page, you can see the list of your virtual machines available to your user only.

.. figure:: _static/VMs_List_User2.png

If you are a Domain Administrator you can see the virtual machines of all users in the domain. 
   
You can change the data representation of existing virtual machines from "card" to "list". We have added the switch |view icon|/|box icon| in the upper-right corner of each section. This improvement gives a user an opportunity to work with data in each specific section in a more convenient way.

A list view can be switched to a box view:

.. figure:: _static/VMs_List.png

And vice versa, switch a list view to a box view:

.. figure:: _static/VMs_Boxes.png

For each VM in the list you can see the following information: 

- VM name and IP;
- State - shows the VM state by color spot: green for Running, red for Stopped, yellow for changing status;
- OS family;
- CPU;
- RAM;
- Disks.

To the right the Actions button |actions icon| expands the list of actions available for the VM.

Filtering of Virtual Machines
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The filtering and search tool will help you to find a virtual machine in the list. 

.. figure:: _static/VMs_FilterAndSearch_User2.png
   
You can filter the VM list by accounts (available for Domain Administrators) and/or zones and/or groups and/or states. In the drop-down lists tick the filtering parameters and see the immediate result.

Besides, VMs can be grouped by zones and/or groups and/or colors and/or accounts. Grouping makes it easier to identify necessary VMs on the list.

.. figure:: _static/VMs_Filter.png
   
Use the search tool to find a virtual machine by its name or a part of the name.

Under the *Virtual Machines* section, you can open a form to create a new virtual machine.

.. _Create_VM:

Create a Virtual Machine 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Creating a new VM in CloudStack-UI is a one-step action. You can select options from one screen without additional steps.

Please, note that a virtual machine is created with a root disk so you do not need to add any volume at the VM creation step. If necessary, you can add a data disk to the VM later.

.. _static/VMs_CreationOverview.png

To create a new VM click the "Create" button |create icon| at the bottom-right corner. 

.. figure:: _static/VMs_Create4.png
   
The *New virtual machine* form contains two tabs: *General* and *Advanced*. 

In the *General* tab the following fields should be filled in:

.. note:: Required fields are marked with an asterisk (*).

1. **Name** * - A name of VM. The system suggests a meaningful autogenerated name in the following form ``vm-<username>-<counter>``. You can enter any name you wish. It should start with a letter, contain figures and Latin letters (up to 63 symbols) and be unique within the domain.
2. **Zone** * - A zone of VM operation. Select a zone from the drop-down list. The list of available zones is managed by a Root Administrator. More information about zones in CloudStack can be found in the `official documentation <http://docs.cloudstack.apache.org/en/4.11.1.0/conceptsandterminology/concepts.html#about-zones>`_.
3. **Service offerings** * -  Select a set of options and resources for a VM, such as templates for creating virtual machines, disk storage, and other. In the block you can see a default service offering specified in the `configuration file <https://github.com/bwsw/cloudstack-ui/blob/master/config-guide.md#default-compute-offering>`_ 

Click "SELECT" in the Service Offerings block and choose any other option you wish in the modal window. 

.. figure:: _static/VMs_Create_SO_Custom_Change5.png

The list of available service offerings is managed by an Administrator. Service offering availability is determined by zone in the `configuration file <https://github.com/bwsw/cloudstack-ui/blob/master/config-guide.md#service-offering-availability>`_. The list of service offerings can be of two types: Fixed and Custom.

*Fixed* service offerings are the offerings with fixed parameters. They can not be changed. 

*Custom* service offerings are offerings with adjustable parameters. You can set the amount of CPU cores, CPU memory and Network rate as you need. 

Use the switcher "Fixed/Custom" above the list to select a necessary type of offerings. 

If service offering classes are determined in the configuration file (see the `configuration guide <https://github.com/bwsw/cloudstack-ui/blob/master/config-guide.md#compute-offering-classes>`_), the list of service offerings is displayed as a list grouped by the determined classes. You can filter the list by classes using the filtering tool above the list. Classes provide additional semantics defining the purpose of VM. 

.. figure:: _static/VMs_Create_SOClasses.png

You also can use the search tool to find an option in the list by a name or a part of the name.

**Fixed Service Offerings**

For fixed service offerings the parameters are provided in the table per each option. Four main parameters are provided by default. They are:

- CPU Cores;
- CPU (MHz);
- Memory (MB);
- Network Rate (Mb/s).

Click "SHOW ADDITIONAL FIELDS" to the right to expand the range of parameters. Scroll the table to right and you will see:

- Disk read rate (Mb/s);
- Disk write rate (Mb/s);
- Disk read rate (IO/s);
- Disk write rate (IO/s).

You can hide the additional parameters by clicking "HIDE ADDITIONAL FIELDS".

.. figure:: _static/VMs_Create_SO_AdditionalFields.png   

Choose the option in the list and click "SELECT" below.

.. figure:: _static/VMs_Create_SO_Select1.png   

The settings will appear for the VM service offerings. 

**Custom Service Offerings**

For custom service offerings the parameters are also provided in the table per each option. Besides, you can see more parameters by clicking "SHOW ADDITIONAL FIELDS". 

By selecting an option in the list, you open a modal window where you can set values for the following parameters:

- CPU Cores;
- CPU (MHz);
- Memory (MB).

These parameters can be predefined in the `configuration file <https://github.com/bwsw/cloudstack-ui/blob/master/config-guide.md#default-compute-offering>`_ by an Administrator. The values specified there will be used as default parameters for a custom service offering.

Administrators can set limits for custom service offering parameters in the `configuration file <https://github.com/bwsw/cloudstack-ui/blob/master/config-guide.md#custom-compute-offering-parameters>`_. That means you cannot set values larger than the limits specified for custom service offerings. 

Besides, the system checks the available account resources. And if you try to enter a value larger than the available amount of resources, the system will automatically change it to the maximum available value.

.. figure:: _static/VMs_Create_SO_Custom2.png   
   
Click "CONFIRM" to set the custom service offering parameters. The modal window will close and the set values will appear in the list for the selected custom service offerings option. Click "CANCEL" to drop all the settings.

Click "SELECT" below the list to assign a selected service offering to your machine. The custom settings will appear for the VM service offerings. Custom service offering parameters are saved to account tags (see the `list of tags <https://github.com/bwsw/cloudstack-ui/wiki/Tags>`_) if they are supported for the account. This will make it easier for you to use saved custom parameters for service offerings next time at VM creation as they will be predefined in the form automatically. 

.. Account tags can be switched on in the `configuration file <https://github.com/bwsw/cloudstack-ui/blob/master/config-guide.md#account-tags-enabled>`_  by an Administrator. 

.. note:: The system checks the amount of available account resources. In case a selected service offering does not fit the amount of available account resources, a warning message will appear saying the offering cannot be selected. 

4. **Installation source** * - Select an installation source - a Template or an ISO file - that will be used to create the machine from. In the block you can see the installation source selected by default. Click "Select" to choose an installation source you wish. In a modal window you will see a list of templates/ISOs with the "Ready" status available for the selected zone as well as for user's account or the whole domain. 
   
   The filtering tool allows finding a necessary option by selecting among templates/ISOs by OS families, types and groups, or search the source by a name or a part of its name. 
   
   Tick the source in the list and click "SELECT" to implement the selected source.
   
   Click "CANCEL" to drop selected options. No source will be selected then.   

.. figure:: _static/VMs_Create_IstallationSource2.png
    
The Disk size slider below the **Installation source** block allows changing the size of a root-disk of the VM. The default minimum size is determined by the account limits and shown in the number field. Move the slider or enter a number value in the field to set the root-disk size.
   
.. figure:: _static/VMs_Create_IstallationSource_DiskSize.png

5. **Disk offering** - Available if ISO is selected as a source. Here you can see a disk offering preselected for the machine. To choose another disk offering open a modal window by clicking "SELECT" in the disk offering section and choose a disk offering in the list of available disk offerings. The list of available options is managed by an Administrator. Disk offering availability is determined by the zone defined in the `configuration file <https://github.com/bwsw/cloudstack-ui/blob/master/config-guide.md#service-offering-availability>`_.

.. figure:: _static/VMs_Create_DO1.png

For each disk offering you can expand detailed information by clicking the arrow icon or the whole line in the list. In the appeared section you will see a range of parameters. The following parameters are shown by default:

- Bandwidth (MB/s): Read/Write rates;
- IOPS: Read/Write rates and Min/Max values;
- Storage type;
- Provisioning type;
- Creation date.

Use the scrolling tool to view them all.

More parameters can be added via the `configuration file <https://github.com/bwsw/cloudstack-ui/blob/master/config-guide.md#disk-offering-parameters>`_ by an Administrator.
Select a disk offering in the list and click "SELECT".

.. figure:: _static/VMs_Create_DO1_Expanded.png

If the selected disk offering has a custom disk size (it is set by Administrator), you can change the disk size. Move the slider up to the volume size you wish.

.. figure:: _static/VMs_Create_DO_ChangeSize2.png

.. The system checks the amount of available account resources. In case a selected disk offering does not fit the amount of available account resources, a warning message appears saying the offering cannot be selected. 

Find more about disk offerings in the `official documentation <http://docs.cloudstack.apache.org/en/4.11.1.0/adminguide/service_offerings.html?highlight=disk%20offerings#compute-and-disk-service-offerings>`_.

In the *Advanced* tab you will find the following fields:

.. figure:: _static/VMs_Create_Advanced.png

1. **Group** - Select a group from the drop-down list. Or create a new group by typing its name right in the field. The group will be saved to the machine `tags <https://github.com/bwsw/cloudstack-ui/wiki/Tags>`_.
2. **Affinity group** - Select an affinity group in the list or create a new group filling in the form. By clicking "SELECT" in the block you open a form with the list of existing groups and a creation block above the list.

    **Create an Affinity group**. To create a new affinity group you should fill in the form at the top of the dialog box:
    
    - Name * - Enter a name for the group. The name should contain letters, figures, start with a letter and should not contain spaces. Maximum length is 63 symbols.
    
    - Type * - Select type of the group - "anti-affinity" or "affinity".
    
    - Description - Provide a short description. Maximum length is 63 symbols.
    
    Click "+" to add the new group with the specified settings to the list.
    
    **Select a group**. Click on a group in the list and press "SELECT". 
    
    What an affinity group is you can read in the `official documentation <http://docs.cloudstack.apache.org/en/4.11.1.0/adminguide/virtual_machines.html?highlight=Affinity%20group#affinity-groups>`_.
    
3. **Firewall rules** - Select a security group for the machine. Click "EDIT" to specify a security group for the VM. A default security group, defined in `the configuration file <https://github.com/bwsw/cloudstack-ui/blob/master/config-guide.md#default-security-group-name>`_, is shown in this field. To change it click "EDIT". In the appeared window choose between "Create new" or "Select Shared" options. 
  
**Create a new security group**

A new security group can be created on the base of templates. This security group will be created as a *private* group used for this VM only.

When creating a new security group, you can see the templates in the "All templates" section of the modal window. To form your custom security group, select a template in the "All templates" list at the left and move it to the "Selected templates" list at the right by clicking the arrow icon:
   
.. figure:: _static/VMs_Create_AddSecGr_New.png
   
Click "SELECT ALL" to move all templates from left to right at once.

Click "RESET" to drop all selected templates.

In the list below you will see the rules corresponding to the selected templates. All of them are checked as selected. Uncheck those you do not wish to add to your VM as firewall rules.

Click "SAVE" to apply the selected rules to your virtual machine.

Click "CANCEL" to drop the selected options. No rules will be assigned to the virtual machine. You will return to the "Create new virtual machine" window.
   
**Select Shared security group**
   
If you would like to select an existing group of firewall rules, you can click the "Select Shared" option and tick those groups in the list that you want to assign to your VM. The security groups in the *Shared* list are used by other VMs in the domain. That means you won't be able to uncheck some rules in the group that you do not want to include into the list (like at creating VM from a template). You can assign only the whole shared security group to your VM. 
   
.. figure:: _static/VMs_Create_AddSecGr_Shared1.png

You can edit a shared security group after the VM is created. In the *Network* tab of the VM details sidebar the assigned shared security group(s) can be viewed and edited. Please, find more information on security group editing in the :ref:`VM_Network_Tab` section.

Click "Cancel" to drop the selected options. No rules will be assigned to the virtual machine. 
   
4. **SSH keypair** - Select an SSH keypair. The list of keys contains the SSH keys available for the account under which the VM is being created. Find more information on SSH keys in the :ref:`SSH_Keys` section.
5. **Start VM** - Tick the box to start the VM right after its deployment. If this option is activated, the VM acquires an IP and a password (if required by the template). If it is not, the machine IP is not available till VM is started, no password is assigned to it.

Once all fields are filled in, click "Create".

For some templates/ISOs used at VM creation you are offered to accept a "Template/ISO Terms and Conditions Agreement". An administrator is able to specify an agreement for a template or ISO. An agreement may determine, for example, software licensing terms or restrictions on the liability of the software template vendor. A user must confirm it to continue VM installation from a chosen source. 

If you are creating a virtual machine on the base of a template/ISO that requires an agreement, read the terms in the appeared window and click "I AGREE" to continue.

.. figure:: _static/VMs_Create_Agreement.png

Click "CANCEL" to close the terms and move back to the creation form. Change the installation source.

After clicking "CREATE", a dialog window will appear where you can monitor the VM creation process: security group creation, virtual machine deployment, template tags copying, etc. These procedures are fulfilled one by one. A procedure in progress is marked with a spinner in the message. In case of an error occurring at any VM creation step, a user can understand at what step it has happened.

.. figure:: _static/VMs_Create_Logger.png

Once the VM creation process finishes, the success message will inform you of that. 

.. figure:: _static/VMs_Create_SuccessMessage.png
   
The message will show the list of all creation steps and the virtual machine information:

- VM name and IP (if it is available),

- VM Password - This field appears after the VM creation if a password is enabled for the template used for creating this machine. A password is autogenerated. Click "SAVE" next to it in the dialog window if you want to save it for this VM. The password will be saved to the VM tags. You can see the saved password later by clicking "Access VM" in the Actions box for this machine.

.. figure:: _static/VMs_Create_Dialogue_SavePass.png

The system will ask you if you wish to save passwords to VM tags by default for the virtual machines created in the future. Click "Yes" and the "Save VM password by default" option will be activated in the account settings:

.. figure:: _static/Settings_SavePass2.png

It means the password will be saved to tags automatically for all created virtual machines.

From this window, you can access the VM opening VNC console.

.. API log 

Close the dialog window and make sure the newly created VM is in the list of virtual machines.

Click "CANCEL" to drop the VM creation.

Possible Issues When Creating a Virtual Machine
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

You can face the following issues when creating a virtual machine:

- Lack of resources.

  An important thing in CloudStack-UI is that the system immediately checks that a user has the amount of resources required to create a virtual machine. It does not allow launching the creation of a VM which will fail for sure because of the resource lack.

  If you lack the required amount of resources, the message will appear when clicking "Create Virtual Machine":

  "Insufficient resources. You ran out of Primary storage." 
 
  No VM creation form is available.
 
.. If there are insufficient resources you will not be allowed to create a new VM and start it upon creation. You will be able to create a new VM with the unchecked "Start VM" option. No IP is assigned to the VM in this case.

- VM name is not unique.

  If the name specified for the virtual machine is not unique within a domain, the dialog window after VM creation will show an error. The VM will not be created. The creation form will be closed. You will have to open the VM creation form and fill it in again. You will have to specify another name for your VM.

.. _VM_Actions:

VM Action Box
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Once a VM instance is created, you can stop, restart, or delete it as needed. These actions are available under the "Actions" button |actions icon| to the right from each virtual machine in the list. 

.. figure:: _static/VMs_ActionBox2.png
   
It allows performing the following actions with the VM:

- Start VM - Allows a user to launch a VM, 

- Stop VM - Allows a user to stop a running VM, 

- Reboot VM - Allows a user to restart a VM, 

- Reinstall VM - Allows a user to reinstall a VM, 

- Destroy VM - Allows a user to delete a VM. After deleting the virtual machine will remain in the system. It will look faded in the list and can be recovered later. 

.. figure:: _static/VMs_Destroyed.png

To recover a destroyed VM (which is not expunged) open the Actions list and click "Recover".

.. figure:: _static/VMs_RestoreDeletedVM.png

Click "Expunge" to completely destroy the VM. The VM will not be available for recovering anymore.

.. figure:: _static/VMs_DestroyExpunge.png

When deleting a virtual machine, if the machine has data disks attached, the system will ask you in a dialog window whether these disks should be deleted. If data disks have snapshots, you will be offered to delete the snapshots as well by activating a "Delete snapshots" option in the dialog. 

Confirm your intention to delete disks (and snapshots) by clicking "Yes". Click "No" to cancel the disk (and snapshots) deleting.

.. figure:: _static/VMs_Destroy_DeleteSnaps.png

- Reset password - Allows a user to change the password for VM (available for started VMs only in case a VM requires a password). The VM will be rebooted if you reset the password. 

.. figure:: _static/VMs_ResetPassDialogue.png

After clicking "Yes" the VM will be rebooted and a new password will be autogenerated for it. You will see the new password in the dialog window. 

.. figure:: _static/VMs_PasswordReset.png

Click "Save" to save the password for this VM. It will activate the "Save VM passwords by default" option in the *Settings* section (see :ref:`Settings_VMPass`). In the future the password will be saved automatically right at VM creation. Click "OK" to close the dialog window. 

- Access VM - Opens an "Access VM" dialog window which allows to view VM name and IP, view and save a password for the VM and access the VM via the VNC console. 

.. figure:: _static/AccessVM_OpenConsole3.png

In the :ref:`VM_Access` section you can find more information on accessing a VM.

- Pulse - It is a new feature created in CloudStack-UI to visualize the VM performance statistics. By clicking "Pulse" at the Actions box you will open a modal window with 3 tabs: CPU/RAM, Network, Disk. There you can see the charts of resources statistics for the VM.

.. figure:: _static/Pulse.png

You can adjust the graphs by range, data aggregation period, shift interval and other parameters. 

This plugin is convenient for dynamic monitoring of VM performance. Find more information about it in the `official documentation <https://github.com/bwsw/cloudstack-ui/wiki/Pulse-Plugin>`_. Pulse plugin deployment instructions can be found at the :ref:`Pulse_Plugin` page.

.. note:: Please, note, when performing one of the actions from the list, other actions in this list are disabled until the action in progress finishes.

You can take a VM snapshot to preserve all the VM’s data volumes as well as (optionally) its CPU/memory state. This is useful for quick restore of a VM.
 
Click "Take a snapshot" in the disk Actions list and in the dialog window enter the following information:

.. note:: Required fields are marked with an asterisk (*).

- Name of the snapshot * - Define a name for the snapshot. It is auto-generated in the form ``<date>-<time>``. But you can specify any name you wish.
- Description - Add a description of the snapshot to know what it contains. 

.. figure:: _static/VMs_Info_Storage_Snapshot.png

All snapshots are saved in the list of snapshots. In the disk information, you will see the name and time of the *last-taken snapshot*. For each snapshot the list of actions is available. Find more information on snapshot actions in the :ref:`Actions_on_Snapshots` sections below.

**Set up snapshot schedule**

You can schedule regular snapshotting by clicking "Set up snapshot schedule" in the Actions list.

In the appeared window set up the schedule for recurring snapshots:

 - Select the frequency of snapshotting - hourly, daily, weekly, monthly;
 - Select a minute (for hourly scheduling), the time (for daily scheduling), the day of week (for weekly scheduling) or the day of month (for monthly scheduling) when the snapshotting is to be done;
 - Select the timezone according to which the snapshotting is to be done at the specified time;
 - Set the number of snapshots to be made.

Click "+" to save the schedule. You can add more than one schedule but only one per each type (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly).

Tags Tab
""""""""""""""""""""""""

Under this tab, you can create and see the VM tags. 

.. figure:: _static/VMs_Details_Tags1.png
   
CloudStack-UI uses tags very extensively to provide additional UX capabilities. Tags are key-value pairs. So it makes a kind of a key-value storage for the meta-information - VM description or group, or a user language. The tags used by Cloudstack-UI are system tags. They are prefixed with ``csui``. You can find the full list of system tags supported by CloudStack-UI at the `page <https://github.com/bwsw/cloudstack-ui/wiki/Tags>`_.

System tags are used to provide functionality from the user interface perspective. Changing these tags affects the functionality of the application. The "Show system tags" checkbox allows to view or hide system tags of the virtual machine. Uncheck this box to hide system tags from the list. It helps to avoid accidental unwanted changes. If a user has disabled displaying of these tags, the system will remember it and next time tags will also be hidden. 

To find the tag you are interested in, please, use the search tool above the tag list. You can enter a name or a part of the tag name to distinguish it in the list.

.. figure:: _static/VMs_Tag_Search1.png

The tags assigned to the virtual machine are presented in the list. System tags are presented in one card, other tags - in a separate card. For each tag in the list the following actions are available when hovering the mouse over the tag key:

 - Edit - Allows editing the tag. In the appeared form define a new key and/or value (both fields are required). Click "Edit" to save the edits. Click "Cancel" to drop the edits. The tag won't be changed then.
  
 - Delete - Allows deleting the tag. Click "Delete" and confirm your action in the dialog window.

.. figure:: _static/VMs_Details_Tags_Actions3.png
   
**Create Tags**

You can create a tag right from *Tags* tab. 

Click "Create" |create icon| and fill in the appeared form:

.. note:: Required fields are marked with an asterisk (*). You cannot use space as the first symbol.

- Key * - Enter a key here. 
 
- Value * - Enter the value here.

.. figure:: _static/VMs_Tag_CreateNew1.png

When adding a system tag, click "+" in the card to open the creation form. You will see that the ``csui`` prefix is automatically prepopulated here. 

.. figure:: _static/VMs_SystemTag_Create1.png

If you create a non-system tag, it will be saved in a new card. If you have entered a key in the format ``<prefix>.<example>``, a card will be named as "<prefix>". When creating a new tag from this card, click "+" in the card and in the tag creation form the *Key* field will be prepopulated with the <prefix>.

.. figure:: _static/VMs_Tag_Create2.png

.. _VM_Access:

Access a Virtual Machine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Depending on the installation source (ISO or a Template) and tags determined for a VM, the system allows getting an access to the VM interaction interface. Currently, the following access modes are supported:

- Via a VNC console - active by default for all VMs;  

- Via WebShell;

- Via URL.

Selecting "Access VM" in the VM action list, you open a modal window with three tabs. In active tab(s) you can view detailed information for the access option(s) enabled for this machine.
If an access mode is not available for the machine, the tab is inactive. All three options can be enabled at the same time for one machine.

In each tab you can click on a corresponding link to open a VNC console/Webshell/URL.

Below you will find more information on each access mode.

VNC console
""""""""""""""""
This tab contains the following details: 

- Login;

- Password (if available);

- Open VNC console link that opens a console to access the VM.

.. figure:: _static/AccessVM_OpenConsole3.png

WebShell
""""""""""""""""""""""
This tab is active if the access via WebShell is enabled. It is determined by the following tags in VM's template::

 csui.vm.auth-mode = SSH
 csui.vm.ssh.login = login
 csui.vm.ssh.password = password
 csui.vm.ssh.port = port

This tab displays the following details: 

- Connection String (IPv4)

- Connection String (IPv6)

- IPv4

- IPv6

- Port

- Login

- Password

- SSH Key

- Open WebShell - a clickable link to open a WebShell console.

URL
"""""""""""""""
Under this tab you can access a VM via HTTP/HTTPS URL.
This mode is defined by the tags::

 csui.vm.auth-mode = HTTP
 csui.vm.http.protocol = HTTP|HTTPS
 csui.vm.http.port =
 csui.vm.http.path =
 csui.vm.http.login =
 csui.vm.http.password =

.. note:: If no ``csui.vm.http.port`` is defined, then default values are used:
            
            - for HTTPS protocol: 443
            
            - for HTTP protocol: 80 

This tab displays the following information:

- Login;

- Password (if available);

- Open URL with a clickable URL.
