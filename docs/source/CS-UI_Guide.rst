Cloudstack-UI User Guide
=============================
.. Contents::

CloudStack-UI is created to make it easier for end-users to use cloud infrastructure - to view and use their cloud resources, including virtual machines, templates and ISOs, data volumes and snapshots, guest networks, and IP addresses. 

Logging In 
-------------
If you have never worked with CloudStack before, you should start with installing the CloudStack platform. Follow the instruction at `the official documentation <http://docs.cloudstack.apache.org/projects/cloudstack-installation/en/4.9/>`_.

Then deploy CloudStack-UI (link to Deployment documentation).

To enter the platform use your credentials provided by the administrator:

- Login * -   The user ID of your account. 
- Password * - The password associated with the user ID.
- Domain - If you are a root user, leave this field blank. If you are a user in the sub-domains, enter the full path to the domain, excluding the root domain.

.. note:: Required fields are marked with asterisks (*).

.. figure:: _static/LoginScreen.png

Push "Login" to proceed to CloudStack.

Virtual Machines
-------------------

This is the starting page you see when entering the platform. Here and in all other views we implemented the “one step” approach, and we also made it work without moving from view to view. So all actions on VMs can be managed from one screen view.

At this page you can see the list of virtual machines existing in the system.

.. figure:: _static/VMs.png
   :scale: 80%

.. _Resource_Usage:

Resource Usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It is important that now in this section you can see the resource statistics: used and free VMs, computational resources, volumes and storage space. 

Domain Administrators can view resources for their account and for the whole domain.

Unfold Resource Usage panel in the upper part of the screen.

.. figure:: _static/VMs_ResourceUsage.png
   :scale: 80%
   
It provides information on the following resources:

1) Virtual machines;
2) Computational resources - CPU, RAM;
3) Volumes and snapshots;
4) Storage - primary and secondary.

You can view resources for your account or the whole domain, as well as select the information on used or free resources. Click the options that you need above the resource data list.

Filtering of Virtual Machines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The filtering and search tool will help you to find a virtual machine in the list. 

.. figure:: _static/VMs_Filter&Search.png
   :scale: 80%
   
You can filter the VM list by accounts (available for Domain Administrators) and/or zones and/or groups and/or states. In the drop-down lists tick the filtering parameters and see the immediate result.

Besides, VMs can be grouped by zones and/or groups and/or colors and/or accounts. Grouping makes it easier to identify necessary VMs in the list.

.. figure:: _static/VMs_Filter.png
   :scale: 80%
   
Use the search tool to find a virtual machine by its name or a part of the name.

Alerts on Operations with Virtual Machines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the upper-right corner of the screen you can expand the list of pending operations by clicking a bell icon |bell icon|. It informs you of the latest operations with VMs. You can clear the list after its reviewing by deleting every notification one by one or clicking "Clear All" at the list bottom.

.. figure:: _static/VMs_Alerts.png
   :scale: 80%
   
Under the Virtual Machines section you can create a new virtual machine.

.. _Create_VM:

Create a Virtual Machine 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Creating a new VM in CloudStack-UI is a one-step action. You can select options from one screen without additional steps.

An important thing is that the system immediately checks that the user has the amount of resources required to create a virtual machine. Thus, it doesn’t allow him/her to launch creation of a VM which will fail for sure because of the resource lack.

To create a new VM click the "Create" button at the bottom-left corner. 

.. figure:: _static/VMs_Create.png
   :scale: 80%
   
In the *Create VM* form fill in the following fields:

1. Name - A name of VM. The system suggest a meaningful autogenerated name in the following form ``vm-<username>-<counter>``.
2. Zone - A zone of VM operation. Select a zone from the drop-down list. How to add a zone to this list see here (link to Admin zone section) 
3. Service offerings -  A set of options and resources that users can choose from, such as templates for creating virtual machines, disk storage, and more. Select a small instance or a medium instance, or custom (?). The Custom offering option allows to set your own settings on:

    - CPU cores;
    - CPU (MHz);
    - Memory (MB).
    
.. figure:: _static/VMs_Create_SO_Custom.png   

Click "Confirm" to set the custom service offerings. The custom settings will appear for the service offerings. You can change them clicking "Change" next to the settings. Click "Cancel" to drop all the settings.
   
.. figure:: _static/VMs_Create_SO_Custom_Change.png
   
4. Installation source - Click "Select" to choose istallation source. Traditionally, there are two options of the virtual machine creation:
    
    - from a template, 
    - from an ISO file.
    
The filtering tool allows finding a necessary option by selecting among templates/ISOs by OS families, types and groups, or search the source by a name or a part of its name. Tick the source in the list and click "Select" to implement the selected source.
   
   Click "Cancel" to drop selected options. No source will be selected then.   

.. figure:: _static/VMs_Create_IstallationSource.png
   :scale: 80%
    
5. Disk offering - Available if ISO is selected as a source. Select from the drop-down list the option on disks. Change the disk size moving the slider up to the volume size you wish (?).
6. Group - Select a group from the drop-down list. Or create a new group by typing its name right in the field.
7. Affinity group - Select an affinity group from the drop-down list. By defining affinity groups and assigning VMs to them, the user or administrator can influence (but not dictate) which VMs should run on separate hosts. This feature lets users specify that certain VMs won’t be on the same host. Find more information on affinity groups and their addition to the system here (link to Admin AG section).
8. Firewall rules - Click "Edit" to specify a security group for the VM. In the appeared window choose between "Create new" or "Select Shared" options. 
  
**New firewall rules**
 
If you would like to create a new security group, select the templates in the "All templates" list at the left and move it to the "Selected templates" list at the right clicking the arrow icon:
   
.. figure:: _static/VMs_Create_AddSecGr_New.png
   :scale: 80%
   
Click "Select All" to move all templates from left to right at once.

Click "Reset" to drop all selected templates.

In the list below you will see the rules corresponding to the selected templates. All of them are checked as selected. Uncheck those you do not wish to add to your VM as firewall rules.

Click "Save" to apply the selected rules to your virtual machine.

Click "Cancel" to drop the selected options. No rules will be assigned to the virtual machine. You will return to the "Create new virtual machine" window.
   
**Select Shared firewall rules**
   
If you would like to select an existing group of firewall rules, you can click the "Select Shared" option and tick those groups in the list that you want to asssign to your VM. In this case you won't be able to uncheck the rules in the group that you do not want to include into list. You can assign only the whole shared group to your VM. 
   
.. figure:: _static/VMs_Create_AddSecGr_Shared.png
   :scale: 80%
   
Click "Cancel" to drop the selected options. No rules will be assigned to the virtual machine. 
   
8. Keyboard layout - Select a keyboard layout from the drop-down list.
9. SSH keypair - Select a SSH keypair. Find more information on SSH key here (link to SSH keys section).
10. Start VM checkbox - Tick the box to start the VM right at its creation. If this option is activated, the VM acquires an IP and a password. If it is not, the machine IP is not available, no password is assigned to it.

.. note:: Required fields are marked with asterisks (*).

Once all fields are filled in, click "Create" and wait for a while until the VM is created. A dialogue window will appear where you can monitor the VM creation process: security group creation, virtual machine deployment, template tags copying. These procedures are fulfilled one by one. The procedure in process will be marked with a spinner in the message. 

Once the VM creation process finishes, the success message will inform you of that. 

.. figure:: _static/VMs_Create_SuccessMessage.png
   :align: center
   :scale: 80%
   
It will show the virtual machine information:

- VM name,
- VM Password - It is autogenerated. Click "Save" next to the password in the dialogue window if you want to save a password of this VM and all other virtual machines to VM tags by default.
- VM IP.

You are offered to accept the "Template/ISO Terms and Conditions Agreement" to continue.

From this window you can access the VM opening VNC console.

.. API log - ???

Close the dialogue window and make sure the newly created VM is in the list of virtual machines.

Click "Cancel" to drop the VM creation.

Possible Issues When Creating a Virtual Machine
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

(need more info)

You can face the following issues when creating a virtual machine:

1) Lack of resources.
