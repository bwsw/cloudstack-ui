 * The RouterStateSerializer takes the current RouterStateSnapshot
 * and returns any pertinent information needed. The snapshot contains
 * all information about the state of the router at the given point in time.
 * The entire snapshot is complex and not always needed. In this case, you only
 * need the URL and query parameters from the snapshot in the store. Other items could be
 * returned such as route parameters and static route data.
 *
 * NOTE: To use the time-travelling debugging in the Devtools with router-store,
 * you must return an object containing a url property when using the routerReducer.
